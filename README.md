# Fritz

[Fritz](https://github.com/fritz-marshal/fritz) is the science data platform for the [Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)](https://ztf.caltech.edu) Phase II and ZTF-O4

It implements an end-to-end, scalable, API-first system for Time-domain Astronomy and features:
- A multi-survey data archive and alert broker
- An interactive collaborative marshal for the transient, variable, and Solar system science cases
- A workhorse for machine learning applications and active learning
- Follow-up observation management with robotic and classical facilities
- Fine-grained access control

The platform is hosted at https://fritz.science, and documentation is at https://docs.fritz.science.
