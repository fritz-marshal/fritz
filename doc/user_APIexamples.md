# Fritz API examples

[Fritz](https://github.com/fritz-marshal/fritz) has a fully functional API. The documentation 
for the API can be found [here](https://docs.fritz.science/api.html). To avoid users duplicating code and re-inventing the wheel, here are some examples of how users are using the Fritz-API.

### Tools for the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Census of the Local Universe (CLU) Experiment
The CLU team has some tools to download, annotate, and upload sources to Fritz. The code can be found on the [github](https://github.com/AndyTza/ZTF_CLU_Tools/tree/main/scripts) page of Andy Tzanidakis.

### A collection of snippets by Igor Andreoni with Fritz and Kowalksi 
A few python examples to query Kowalski and upload sources and spectra to Fritz. See the [github](https://github.com/igorandreoni/snippets) page of Igor Andreoni.
